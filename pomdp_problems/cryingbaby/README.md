# Crying Baby

This is an example of defining a small, tabular POMDP using pomdp-py
and solving it with different methods.  It illustrates a different
style of using pomdp-py when the domain is very small.

The crying baby domain is defined in the Algorithms for Decision Making book by
M. J. Kochenderfer et al. in section F.7
